## General Information

We have dataset (loan.csv) of a consumer finance company specialises in lending loans.

When the company receives a loan application, it makes one of the two decisions:
1. Accept loan
2. Reject loan

Types of approved applicants:
1. Fully paid - paid the entire loan
2. Charged off - couldn't pay the loan; defaulter
2. Current - loan payment in progress

Based on the data, the aim is to identify patterns which indicate if a person is likely to default to be able to make accurate decisions in the future.

## Conclusions
- Maximum defaulters were in lower income groups
- Maximum defaulters were in loan grade B and C
- Maximum defaulters took loan for the purpose of debt consolidation
- Applicants who were on rent or mortgage defaulted more than applicants who owned houses
- California, New York and Florida had the highest rate of defaulters
- Majority of defaulter applicants were not verified by the bank
- Longer payment term seemed to have lesser defaulters
- Over the years, the number of defaulters has rapidly increased
