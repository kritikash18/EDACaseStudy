## General Information

We have dataset (loan.csv) of a consumer finance company specialises in lending loans.

When the company receives a loan application, it makes one of the two decisions:
1. Accept loan
2. Reject loan

Types of approved applicants:
1. Fully paid - paid the entire loan
2. Charged off - couldn't pay the loan; defaulter
2. Current - loan payment in progress

Based on the data, the aim is to identify patterns which indicate if a person is likely to default to be able to make accurate decisions in the future.
